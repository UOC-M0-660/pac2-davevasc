In the case where you wouldnâ€™t be able to use this dependency you would have to write about 70 lines of code to create a similar but smaller framework. This framework has some really cool features which we will not cover today, but it is nice to mention them. This framework can download images and save them to the device, it can cache the images for a specific session, and many more. Today we will only display the image, not download it. Eventually I will do a cache tutorial on android because it is a fun topic. Now lets show you that magic line of code</string>
